    Note:
        Ideally, you don't need to create any instance for this class, as it is completely
        managed by :class:`Manager` (in particular, see
        :attr:`processor <orcha.lib.Manager.processor>`). The diagram above is posted for
        informational purposes, as this class is big and can be complex in some situations
        or without knowledge about multiprocessing. Below a detailed explanation on how
        it works is added to the documentation so anyone can understand the followed
        process.

    1. **Queues**

    The point of having four :py:class:`queues <queue.Queue>` is that messages are traveling
    across threads in a safe way. When a message is received from another process, there is
    some "black magic" going underneath the
    :py:class:`BaseManager <multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager>` class involving pipes, queues
    and other synchronization mechanisms.

    With that in mind, take into account that messages are not received (yet) by our
    process but by the manager server running on another IP and port, despite the fact that
    the manager is ours.

    That's why a
    `proxy <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#proxy-objects>`_
    object is involved in the entire equation. For summarizing, a proxy object is an object
    that presumably lives in another process. In general, writing or reading data from a
    proxy object causes every other process to notice our action (in terms that a new item
    is now available for everyone, a deletion happens for all of them, etc).

    If we decide to use :py:class:`queues <multiprocessing.Queue>` instead, additions
    or deletions won't be propagated to the rest of the processes as it is a local-only
    object.

    For that reason, there is four queues: two of them have the mission of receiving
    the requests from other processes and once the request is received by us and is
    available on our process, it is then added to an internal priority queue by the
    handler threads (allowing, for example, sorting of the petitions based on their
    priority, which wouldn't be possible on a proxied queue).

    2. **Threads**

    As you may notice, there is almost two threads per queue: one is a **producer** and
    the other one is the **consumer** (following the producer/consumer model). The need
    of so much threads (5 at the time this is being written) is **to not to block** any
    processes and leave the orchestrator free of load.

    As the queues are synchronous, which means that the thread is forced to wait until
    an item is present (see :py:attr:`Queue.get() <queue.Queue.get>`), waiting for petitions
    will pause the entire main thread until all queues are unlocked sequentially, one after
    each other, preventing any other request to arrive and being processed.

    That's the reason why there are two threads just listening to proxied queues and placing
    the requests on another queue. In addition, the execution of the action is also run
    asynchronously in order to not to block the main thread during the processing (this
    also applies to the evaluation of the :attr:`condition <orcha.interfaces.Petition.condition>`
    predicate).

    Each time a new thread is spawned for a :class:`Petition`, it is saved on a list of
    currently running threads. There is another thread running from the start of the
    :class:`Process` which is the **garbage collector**, whose responsibility is to
    check which threads on that list have finished and remove them when that happens.

    Warning:
        When defining your own :attr:`action <orcha.interfaces.Petition.action>`, take special
        care on what you will be running as any deadlock may block the entire pipeline
        forever (which basically is what deadlocks does). Your thread must be error-free
        or must include a proper error handling on the **server manager object**.

        This also applies when calling :func:`shutdown`, as the processor will wait until
        all threads are done. In case there is any deadlock in there, the processor will
        never end and you will have to manually force finish it (which may cause zombie
        processes or memory leaks).

    .. versionadded:: 0.1.7
        Processor now supports an attribute :attr:`look_ahead <orcha.lib.Processor.look_ahead>`
        which allows defining an amount of items that will be pop-ed from the queue,
        modifying the default behavior of just obtaining a single item.

    .. versionadded:: 0.1.8
        Manager calls to :func:`on_start <orcha.lib.Manager.on_start>` and
        :func:`on_finish <orcha.lib.Manager.on_finish>` are performed in a mutex environment,
        so there is no need to do any kind of extra processing at the
        :func:`condition <orcha.interfaces.Petition.condition>` function. Nevertheless, the
        actual action run there should be minimal as it will block any other process.

    .. versionadded:: 0.1.9
        Processor supports a new attribute
        :attr:`notify_watchdog <orcha.lib.Processor.notify_watchdog>`
        that defines if the processor shall create a background thread that takes care of
        notifying systemd about our status and, if dead, to restart us.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.3.0
        There is no ``notify_watchdog`` attribute, behavior is now leveraged to a pluggable.

    Args:
        queue (multiprocessing.Queue, optional): queue in which new :class:`Message` s are
                                                 expected to be. Defaults to :obj:`None`.
        finishq (multiprocessing.Queue, optional): queue in which signals are expected to be.
                                                   Defaults to :obj:`None`.
        manager (:class:`Manager`, optional): manager object used for synchronization and action
                                              calling. Defaults to :obj:`None`.

        look_ahead (:obj:`int`, optional): amount of items to look ahead when querying the queue.
            Having a value higher than 1 allows the processor to access items further in the queue
            if, for any reason, the next one is not available yet to be executed but the second
            one is (i.e.: if you define priorities based on time, allow the second item to be
            executed before the first one). Take special care with this parameter as this may
            cause starvation in processes.

    Raises:
        ValueError: when no arguments are given and the processor has not been initialized yet.
