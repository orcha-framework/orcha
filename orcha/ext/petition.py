    This class must have the ability to being created from an existing
    :class:`Message`, as this is the only item that can be exchanged during
    inner process communication.

    It is composed by multiple attributes:

     - :attr:`priority` defines the priority of the petition.
     - :attr:`id` is a unique identifier for the petition.
     - :attr:`queue` is a :py:class:`Queue <multiprocessing.Queue>` that can
       be sent across processes.
     - :attr:`action` represents the callable that will be executed.
     - :attr:`condition` is a predicate which defines whether the petition
       can be run or not.
     - :attr:`state` is the internal state of the petition, defined by the
       enum :class:`PetitionState`.

    This class is intended to be a stub so your implementation must inherit
    from this one.

        We define our own equality and comparison operators, there is no need
        in subclasses declaring fields as ``compare=False``. It is only checked

        tests).

        be overridden by all subclasses that inherit from :class:`Petition`. Such

        received.

        .. warning::
