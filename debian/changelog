python3-orcha (0.3.0-rc5) unstable; urgency=critical

  * Add new possible state reachable from "CANCELLED"

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Thu, 3 Nov 2022 13:29:00 +0100

python3-orcha (0.3.0-rc4) unstable; urgency=critical

  * Refactor of Orcha's internals so it uses less mutual exclusion zones
    and ensures better performance when handling high load demands

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Thu, 3 Nov 2022 10:58:00 +0100

python3-orcha (0.3.0-rc3) unstable; urgency=critical

  * Third release candidate for Orcha, adding support for Pluggable interface.
    This release is **not backward compatible** as some methods/functions are
    deprecated or have changed completely.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Thu, 27 Oct 2022 16:26:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.2.6-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix a race condition when calling "condition" and then "on_start" that
    could lead to potential issues as a condition may evaluate to true but
    when reserving the resources another petition had already taken them,
    leading to an invalid value (i.e.: negative resource amount).

python3-orcha (0.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Minor bug fixes.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Wed, 07 Sep 2022 10:00:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.2.6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Managers now leverage all the logic to the "on_start" and "on_finish" functions,
    keeping its internals defined at "start_petition" and "finish_petition" methods
    that are called by the processor and usually are not overriden.

  * "on_finish" now returns nothing and is ensured to be called only iff the petition
    existed and was running.

  * "on_start" returns a boolean but is also ensured to be called only iff the petition
    belongs to us, it is, is a non-internal petition.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Tue, 06 Sep 2022 17:35:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.2.5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Processor handles unhealthy "on_start" results, directly calling "on_finish"
    when failed to start a petition. An update is required for those modules
    implementing such function with custom behavior as "None" results will
    be translated into an unhealthy status.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Tue, 06 Sep 2022 11:45:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.2.4-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix an issue with watchdog embedded plugin.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Wed, 31 Aug 2022 10:30:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.2.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Move watchdog logic to manager so processor is petition independent while
    running.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Wed, 31 Aug 2022 09:30:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Orcha has now native support for SystemD watchdog timers.
  * Installation now deploys a template service that should be used by
    plugins (when running in SystemD mode) for setting the watchdog.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Tue, 30 Aug 2022 12:30:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Petitions now have an internal state which represents its status. This
    allows cancelling a petition even if it has not been started yet.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Mon, 01 Aug 2022 11:31:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Minor fix for subclasses inheriting from SignalingPetition, which
    didn't allow default values.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Mon, 04 Jul 2022 12:05:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Petitions now support new attributes for defining how to end the process they
    spawned. Such methods allow defining the signal that may be sent to the process,
    whether to kill also parent process or to call a provided function that receives
    the petition itself, for running a custom command. For that reason, two new
    subclasses are now defined for sending a signal or running a function.

  * Petition class now has an abstract method "terminate" which receives the PID
    of the process to terminate and must be overridden by subclasses. This is a
    breaking change, so we jumped to version 0.2.0.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Mon, 04 Jul 2022 12:00:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.1.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Key parameter is not mandatory anymore - some plugins may not require it for working.
  * Improve authentication error messages by giving some extra information.
  * `connect` (from "lib/manager") now returns a boolean indicating whether the connection
    was successful or not.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Thu, 16 Jun 2022 09:00:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.1.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix internal digest key for Orcha clients that was causing an exception
    on Python versions lower or equal than 3.7.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Wed, 15 Jun 2022 15:50:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.1.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improve watchdog mechanism by leveraging the handling to the internal
    processor, the same that handles all the petitions (and which could fail
    due to a deadlock or being blocked or any queue mechanism not working as
    expected).

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Thu, 19 May 2022 09:25:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Processor class is now more resilient and handles unexpected exceptions by
    notifying SystemD about our status more frequently. If an unexpected error
    happens (and we are a SystemD service), the watchdog will be triggered and
    we expect to be restarted.
  * Petition objects now implement both equality and comparison operators. We
    relied on dataclasses for such purpose but we've seen some exceptions that
    are happening when an EmptyPetition (for notifying that we have finished) is
    enqueued. Looks like dataclass' __eq__ and __lt__ operators require both
    objects to be exactly the same class, and it does not support subclasses.

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Mon, 17 May 2022 09:00:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Protect manager "on_start" and "on_finish" calls with a mutex region

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Mon, 18 Apr 2022 09:55:00 +0200

python3-orcha (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add `look_ahead' parameter to the orchestrator processor

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Mon, 21 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0100

python3-orcha (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Support for string identifiers in messages/petitions

 -- Javier Alonso <jalonso@teldat.com>  Fri, 18 Feb 2022 08:50:00 +0100

python3-orcha (0.1.5b11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add support for SystemD services
  * New dependency: python3-systemd

python3-orcha (0.1.5b10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release
