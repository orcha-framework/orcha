python3-orcha (0.2.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Minor fix for subclasses inheriting from SignalingPetition, which
    didn't allow default values.

python3-orcha (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Petitions now support new attributes for defining how to end the process they
    spawned. Such methods allow defining the signal that may be sent to the process,
    whether to kill also parent process or to call a provided function that receives
    the petition itself, for running a custom command. For that reason, two new
    subclasses are now defined for sending a signal or running a function.

  * Petition class now has an abstract method "terminate" which receives the PID
    of the process to terminate and must be overridden by subclasses. This is a
    breaking change, so we jumped to version 0.2.0.

python3-orcha (0.1.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Key parameter is not mandatory anymore - some plugins may not require it for working.
  * Improve authentication error messages by giving some extra information.
  * `connect` (from "lib/manager") now returns a boolean indicating whether the connection
    was successful or not.

python3-orcha (0.1.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix internal digest key for Orcha clients that was causing an exception
    on Python versions lower or equal than 3.7.

python3-orcha (0.1.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improve watchdog mechanism by leveraging the handling to the internal
    processor, the same that handles all the petitions (and which could fail
    due to a deadlock or being blocked or any queue mechanism not working as
    expected).

python3-orcha (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Processor class is now more resilient and handles unexpected exceptions by
    notifying SystemD about our status more frequently. If an unexpected error
    happens (and we are a SystemD service), the watchdog will be triggered and
    we expect to be restarted.
  * Petition objects now implement both equality and comparison operators. We
    relied on dataclasses for such purpose but we've seen some exceptions that
    are happening when an EmptyPetition (for notifying that we have finished) is
    enqueued. Looks like dataclass' __eq__ and __lt__ operators require both
    objects to be exactly the same class, and it does not support subclasses.
